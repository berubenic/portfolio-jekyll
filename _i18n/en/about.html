<h3>From Soldier to Forester to Coder</h3>
<article>
    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>I am an aspiring self-taught web developer looking to put his newfound skills to the test. After 8 years of playing violin, I served three years in the Canadian Armed Forces as an Infantry Soldier. It was like going on a big camping trip. At least that's what they told me. At the end of my contract, I thought a job out in the woods would be the perfect fit for me. Therefore, I studied for a year in trade school to become a Forester. It turns out that enjoying a hike in the woods on weekends is not the same as walking through dense wild forests with mosquitoes, black flies, and the occasional deer or bear encounter. Crossing my fingers these don't exist in my future workspace.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a family of seven kids. I went to elementary school in English and high school in French. Both languages were thrown around the house as if they were one. I can confidently say I am bilingual in French and English. We lived a modest way and were taught that hard work and honesty pay off. Through my family, learning a new instrument on my own and my past professional experiences I have proved to myself that I have the grit necessary to accomplish whatever task or challenge that is headed my way.</p>
    <p>When I first picked up coding, I was immediately hooked. The constant challenges and learning opportunities are endless. The feeling of solving a problem you were struggling with endlessly is priceless. The online community as a whole is amazing. This is something I am keen to be a part of. I have the discipline, leadership, and teamwork skills necessary to get work done. Through these struggles and aspirations, I think I have enough to offer to be a valuable team member.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Nicholas Bérubé</p>
