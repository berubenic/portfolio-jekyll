### CLI Chess game made with Ruby

* Built using Object Oriented Programming principles in mind:
	* **Encapsulation**: Grouping ressembling logic together through classes.
	* **Abstraction**: Letting classes know as little as possible to each other.
	* **Inheritance**: Each different piece inherits from the Piece super class.
	* **Polymorphism**: Each different piece can behave like it's parent Piece class.
* Thoroughly tested using Rspec.
* Save a match in progress thanks to serialization.
